# This script is an example of a Flask application that provides a web interface for creating new blog posts. It uses the Flask framework to handle HTTP requests and render an HTML template (index.html). When the user submits the form to create a new blog post, the data is retrieved from the request and used to generate a JSX code snippet for the new blog post. The JSX code is then saved to a file (Blog-X.jsx) with the provided data. This script is intended to be run as a Flask application, and you would need to set up the Flask environment and routes to make it work. It's a Flask application that provides a web interface to create new blog posts. It is suitable if you want to create a web application where users can dynamically create blog posts through a form.
